Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe React Application! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using React.js.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay: Play against a friend locally on the same device.
- Interactive UI: Enjoy a user-friendly interface designed with React components.
- Win detection: The game automatically detects wins, draws, and allows for easy resetting of the board.

## How to Play

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. You'll see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
3. Player 1 starts the game by clicking on any empty cell to place their symbol (X).
4. Player 2 then takes their turn, placing their symbol (O) in an empty cell.
5. Players continue taking turns until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
6. To start a new game, simply click the "Restart" button.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
